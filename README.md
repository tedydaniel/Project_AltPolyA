# Project_AltPolyA

The pipeline is not final. 
The input data is the output of the ESAT tool:  https://github.com/garber-lab/ESAT. 
The output planed to be as a heat-maps or as a list of genes. 

The GUI is looking for the file with '3end' and 'annot' extentions within the data folder.
If you want to use this GUI don't forget to change the extentions of the ESAT output files 
from 'txt' to '3end' and the annotations file from 'txt' to 'annot'.
